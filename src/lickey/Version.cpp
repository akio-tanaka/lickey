	* "issue is date when this license file is isseud (8 digit integer)

	* "data" section stores as base64
	** the first 4 byte version of license file format
	** 32 byte before decrypt of data is explicit salt as base64
	** the other data is encrypted data
	* encryption key = hardware key, explicit salt, vendorName, appName and sign at the first feature digested MD5

	* implicit salt(32 byte) as base64
	* date to use last(8 digit integer)

	# salt
	* both explicit and implicit salt are updated for each launching application
	* key to decrypt "data" section is generated with MD5("hadrware information" + explicit salt)
